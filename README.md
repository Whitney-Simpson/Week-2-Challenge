# Week-2-Challenge
Creating a Professional Portfolio
## Description
In the Week-2-Challenge we were asked to create a profession profile from scratch that would give a potential employer a sample of previous work. The guidelines that were being asked included the following.
-When I load thier portfolio
- Then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, thier work, and how to contact them.
- When I click one of the links in the navigation
- Then the UI scrolls to the corresponding seciton
- When I click on the link to the seciton about their work
- Then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- When I am presented with the developer's first application
- Then that applicaiton's image should be larger in size than the others
- When I click on the images of the deployed applications
- Then I am taken to that deployed application
- When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- Then I am presented with a reponsive layout that adapts to my viewport
