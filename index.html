                <p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio!<br>
                    My name is Whitney Simpson. I am a woman who enjoys the outdoors and
                    traveling. When the season is right in Northern Michigan, and I find the time between work
                    I take part in outdoor activities like disc golf, golf, hiking and a good picnic. Traveling a joy
                    and
                    passion my husband and I both share, more history the better. I also am a "pup" mom of 12 years to a
                    sweet girl named Pearl.<br>
                    My work experiences vary from hospitality, management
                    and entreprenuership. Three years ago my husband and I embarked
                    on the journey of becoming liquor store owners.
                    It has been a great experience not only getting to know our customers,
                    but also with understanding the marketing behind
                    our location and the services we should provide. It has also allowed me to
                    work directly with our software and learn how to add, modify, or change it
                    as needed. Along with that we manage several rental properties ranging from
                    commercial to residential.Beyond the last five years my experiences
                    include working in hospitality environments and having my own
                    personnal dog training business. I am looking to further my knowledge and career by taking
                    the journey towards coding to not only learn more,
                    but to expand my range of talents. I currently find CSS to be my favorite,
                    but can see the advantages of also being familiar
                    with Html and JavaScript will be beneficial in the long run.</p>
