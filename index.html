            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio!<br> 
            My name is Whitney Simpson. I am a woman who enjoys the outdoors and 
            traveling. When the season is right in Northern Michigan, and I find the time between work 
            I take part in outdoor activities like disc golf, golf, hiking and a good picnic. Traveling a joy and 
            passion my husband and I both share, more history the better. I also am a "pup" mom of 12 years to a 
            sweet girl named Pearl.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p> My work experiences vary from hospitality, management
            and entreprenuership. Three years ago my husband and I embarked 
            on the journey of becoming liquor store owners.
            It has been a great experience not only getting to know our customers, 
            but also with understanding the marketing behind
            our location and the services we should provide. It has also allowed me to 
            work directly with our software and learn how to add, modify, or change it 
            as needed. Along with that we manage several rental properties ranging from 
            commercial to residential.Beyond the last five years my experiences 
            include working in hospitality environments and having my own
            personnal dog training business. I am looking to further my knowledge and career by taking 
            the journey towards coding to not only learn more,
            but to expand my range of talents. I currently find CSS to be my favorite, 
            but can see the advantages of also being familiar
            with Html and JavaScript will be beneficial in the long run.</p>
